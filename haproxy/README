* Run the haproxy-poller.py in crontab on any node that has access to the HAProxy status page and access to insert data into Zabbix. Path to the configuration file needs to be set in a variable in this script.
* Configure mappings between backends in HAProxy and hosts in Zabbix in the haproxy-poller.ini file.
* Backend nodes should have the Template_HAproxy_backend template.
* Frontend (the nodes running HAproxy) should have the Template_HAproxy_frontend template.

The constraints in this monitoring setup is that multiple frontends cannot be monitored on the same host (without some tweaking) and a node can only have one backend in HAProxy. Some kind of clever support for this without creating sort of duplicate templates for each additional frontend/backend would be nice.

Also, this is for HAProxy 1.3.x so support for many of the nifty parameters in 1.4.x is not supported. But you can easily extend by adding the items in the output dict in haproxy-poller.py as well as adding the required trapper items in the template.
